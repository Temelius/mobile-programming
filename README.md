# Mobile programming course
Courses final task

## Original idea of the app
The idea was to create an app based on [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/) and to be able to
* View all movies
* See the details of a movie on a separate page
* Add a movie to your own list
* Remove a movie from the list
* See your progress on how many movies you've seen with visual progress bar
* Add favorite movies to separate list and see them on your profile page

## Current state of the app
Due to task deadline, I wasn't able to finish the project as I was planned. So some things in the app don't work at the moment.

But I'm planning to continue this project at some point.

### Current functionalities
* View all movies
* See the details of a movie on a separate page
* View the skeleton of the profile page
* See the 'Add to list' and 'Remove from list' Button
  * They actually add to/remove from database but it doesn't work constantly
